v1.2.0-rc1 June 22, 2018
------------------------

Release Notes
-------------

Added support for listing certificates based on various filter criteria.

Bug fixes, documentation and test coverage improvements, UX improvements
based on user feedback and changes to address a variety of static scan
findings (unused code, static security scanning, spelling, linting and more).

Updated to Go version 1.10
Updated baseimage version to 0.4.8

Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------

[FAB-9938] many commands can be manipulated to delete identities or affiliations
This vulnerability has a low severity because to exploit it, one would need to
access the authorization header of the requests. Using HTTPS (TLS) eliminates this
potential. We will be re-evaluating the authorization approach for the v1.3
release.
